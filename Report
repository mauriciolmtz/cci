#Current it setup

At the moment they just have to work with an offline point of purchase in each branch which is inconvenient to keep up to date with all the prices and to have control of the real quantity of groceries at the stores which sometimes could produce overstock or understock and even sales with the wrong price, on the other hand having an offline point of purchase it’s also inconvenient for the pickers because they don’t have easy access to essential information as the price of each product which ends up reducing its performance.

#My recommendations  

As a recommendation, they should begin changing their point of purchase to an online one like “ManagementPro”, which is a software that would allow them to have all their information up to date in their branches and distribution center, where their pickers can easily check for prices and stocks and also upload the orders directly into the system which also would improve the efficiency of the company because they’ll be able to send the orders in a shorter period of time and also would help to have better control of the stocks which would help to reduce wastings for over purchasing of products and to be more aware of possible stealings.
